# Adaptexper

1. Incorporate recycling into S-matrix calculations (this is done but it's weird)
2. Precycling 

# Observations

1. In VERY SMALL SCALE, NOISY experiments
which are probably not reliable, I observed that:
(a) Sometimes recycling outperforms non-recycling for grouped MCV. This occurs both when we use the rec_prop adjustment when calculating the MCV solution. 
(b) It seems like MCV outperforms SDP? But probably not uniformly.
